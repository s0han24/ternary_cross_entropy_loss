-- APA paper did not provide the dataset directly
-- CAmbigNQ dataset : consists of ambigous questions + clarifying questions + (some possible answers and what questions to ask to get those answers)
-- AmbigQA dataset : consists of questions + (some possible interpretations + answers) : NO Clarifying question present

current dataset idea::
some dataset entry example: 
id: 0001,
prompt: Can you tell me about Java?,
candidate_response: Java is an island in Indonesia.,
label: 0,
domain: general knowledge,
split: train

id: 0002,
prompt: Can you tell me about Java?,
candidate_response: Do you mean Java the programming language or the island in Indonesia?,
label: 1,
domain: general knowledge,
split: train


Possible Input-Output Pairs:

      Input          -        Output                       -          Label
Ambigious Question   - Presumptuous Answer                 -            0
Ambigious Question   - Clarifying Question                 -            1
Unambigious Question - Directly answered                   -            1
Unambigious Question - Unneccessary Clarifying Question    -            0


Type 1 : take entires from AMbigQA with multipleQAs, choose any answer at random : {Question, Presumptuous answer, 0}
Type 2 : take entries from CAmbigNQ : {Question, Clarifying Question, 1}
Type 3 : take entries from AmbigQA with singleAnswer : {Question , Answer, 1}
Type 4 : take entries from AmbigQA with singleAnswer + ask AI to create a disambiguated question : {Question, disambiguated question, 0}

About class imbalances:
KTO is robust to class imbalance - we might have to tune lamba_D and lambda_U as per the KTO paper ig..

In the proposal we mentioned we will have questions spanning multiple domains... need to somehow create the dataset for that i guess + idk how KTO adapts to this sort of class imbalance.
